The digit '3' appears in virtually all numbers (this is true of any arbitrary digit)
From 0-9, 10% of integers contain atleast one 3
from 0-99, it appears 19 times, or 19%
from 0-999, 271 times, or 27.1%
At which integer do 50% of the values contain at least one 3?
>> the number 333 counts as one, not 3
